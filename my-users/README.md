![running (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79574031/131267918-2021b94b-a534-4898-ad55-a4146473e9ca.png)
### Algorithm 
- The main operations created which are located in the utils folder are modules which manipulate the main array which carries the information of various users.
- all operations will need access to the main array.
- To create a user a user object is appended to the list - users will have to fill out all the forms to prevent errors when updating user data.
- To update a user the information including the object and it's index in the array needs to be passed into the form to be displayed and edited for submission.
- To delete a user the index of the object needs to be passed to the form and the table displaying the data will have to be rerendered to view the updated array.
